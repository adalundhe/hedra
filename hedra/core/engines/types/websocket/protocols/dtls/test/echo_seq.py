"""PyDTLS sequential echo

This script runs a sequential echo server. It is sequential in that it will
respond without error only to a single client that invokes the following steps
in order:
    * DTLS cookie exchange on port 28000 of localhost
    * DTLS handshake (application-default ciphers)
    * Write and receive echo back for an arbitrary number of datagrams
    * Issue shutdown notification and receive the shutdown notification response

Note that this script's operation is slow and inefficient on purpose: it
invokes the demux without socket select, but with 5-second timeouts after
the cookie exchange; this is done so that one can follow the debug logs when
operating this server from a client shell interactively.
